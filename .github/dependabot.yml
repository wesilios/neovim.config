# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

  # Track Vim plugins defined in configs/1.plugins.vim
  # Dependabot doesnâ€™t natively parse vim-plug, but you can make it check for
  # new commits or releases in plugin repos by listing them manually.
  # Add or remove any you want it to track automatically.
